description=Implements handling of EM4 sleep mode for EFR32. Activating this plugin alone is not enough to cause the chip to reach EM4 sleep. To activate EM4 sleep mode emberAfOKToGoToEM4Callback() must be implemented and conditionally return true. The EM4 plugin only works properly with SINGLE NETWORK configuration. WARNING: Use this plugin at your own discretion. Every EM4 sleep attempt involves a reset. Critical information may get lost if 1. the device goes to em4 in the middle of an operation that has not been considered by emberAfOKToGoToEM4Callback() or 2. important info are not properly stored beforehand by implementing emberPluginEM4BeforeEM4Callback(). 3. using this mode with MULTI NETWORK configuration.
